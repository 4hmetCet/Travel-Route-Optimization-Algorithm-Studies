Constraints:
-- Priority (1,2,3,4,5)
-- Time interval ( ex: 10:00 - 12:00)
-- Related Points( ex: User must visit point A before point B)

Options:
-- Vehicle select (Bike, car, public transport)
-- Stating Point (Current location or chosen location)
-- Ending Point (Starting position or another position)


Algortihm Studies:
-- Cost Matrix: This matrix will include costs of each point

Heuristic approaches : Nearest Neighbour Algorithm, Genetic Algorithm

Nearest Neighbour : 
  Step 1 : Compare all unvisited nodes costs
  Step 2 : Select best node with constraints
  Step 3 : Set this node as visited and go to step 1
